Hi, I am Puhe Hao. I'm currently doing research on audio watermarking under the under the supervision of Prof.[Li Lu](https://lynnlilu.github.io/). I am also a second-year master student in Cyber Security at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT), advised by Prof. [Guozi Sun](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9B9D05C52A432DCFE050007F01006EFE). 
<!-- I am currently visiting MusLab under the supervision of Prof.[Li Lu](https://lynnlilu.github.io/).  -->

<!-- Previously, I graduated from NJUPT with a bachelor's degree in information security in 2024. My past research focused on building a privacy-preserving and economically viable data marketplace. -->
