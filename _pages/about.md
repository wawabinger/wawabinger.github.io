Hi, I am a second-year master student in Cyber Security at [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT)](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Guozi Sun](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9B9D05C52A432DCFE050007F01006EFE). Previously, I graduated from NJUPT with a bachelor's degree of information security in 2024. My past research focused on building a privacy-preserving and economically viable data marketplace.

I'm currently working as a research assistant under th the supervision of Prof.[Li Lu](https://lynnlilu.github.io/). My current research focuses on **Watermarking** and **Deepfake detection** in the audio domain. Welcome to connect with me!
